* Introduction
** Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER)
   - Designed to inform health-care decisions by providing evidence on
     - effectiveness
     - benefits
     - harm
   - Synthesize evidence from /disparate sources/
     - randomized clinical trials
     - observational studies
     - real-world data
     - etc.
   - /Challenge/ is to /address study-specific heterogeneities/ to increase the
     scientific validity and efficiency of such synthesis analysis
** Bayesian Approaches
   - Offer a formal probabilistic framework to combine existing and new
     evidence from both outside and within a study
   - Recommended for /CER/ by many researchers
** Goal
   - Develop a /Bayesian non-parametric/ causal inference model 
   - Synthesize information from /randomized controlled clinical trials/
     and /real-world studies/ for evaluating the causal effect of
     medical interventions
* Motivating Example

** Propensity Score (PS) Adjustment
   - Common approach for /controlling confounding factors/ and 
     adjusting the bias of treatment effects
   - Defined as the /conditional probability/ of assignment to treatment
     given baseline covariates
     - Let \(Z=1\) and \(0\) denote the treatment and the control arm
     - Let \(\uV\) denote the baseline covariates
     - The /propensity score/, \(e(\uV)\), is defined as 
       \[e(\uv) = P(Z=1|\uV=\uv) = E(Z|\uV=\uv)\]

** PS Adjustment

   - For subject \(i\), let \(Y_i(0)\) and \(Y_i(1)\) denote the
     /potential outcome/ under the control and the treatment
   - Assume there are /no unmeasured confounders/ (strongly ignorable
     treatment assignment assumption)
   - The /average treatment effect/ (ATE) can be estimated as
     \[E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)] 
     = E_{e(\uv)} \left[ E\{Y|Z=1, e(\uV)\} - E\{Y|Z=0,e(\uV)\}  \right]
     \]

** PS Adjustment

   - Methods using estimated PS for estimating treatment effects include
     - matching
     - stratification
     - weighting 
     - regression

   - Question 
     - How does /non-parametric propensity score regression/ perform
       compared to other approaches?

** Dirichlet Process (DP)
   - Distribution on space of distributions
   - $G \sim DP(G_0, M)$
   - For any partition $(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m)$ on the support of $G_0$,
     $(G(B_1), \ldots, G(B_m))$ follows a Dirichlet distribution with parameters
     $(M G_0(B_1), \ldots, M G_0(B_m))$
   - As $M$ increases, the variance of $G$ decreases and $G$ is /closer/ to $G_0$
 
** DP Model   

  \begin{align*}
  y_i, e(\uv_i) & |Z_i=z  \sim MVN(F^{(z)}, \Sigma^{(z)}) \\
  F^{(z)} & \sim DP(G^{(z)}, M^{(z)}) \\
  G^{(z)} & \sim N(m^{(z)}, B^{(z)})
  \end{align*}

** Toy Example
   - Assume that there is one covariate $V \sim N(1,1)$
   - Outcome $Y|V=v \sim N(10v, 1)$
   - Randomized study: treatment assignment independent of $V$
   - Observational study: $\logit P(Z=1|V=v) = -5 + 5v$
   - Consider four approaches  
     - Naive estimation
     - PS stratification 
     - Random forest
     - DP

* Method

** Proposal
  - Extend PS adjustment for CER
  - Apply Bayesian Hierarchical DP models for CER 

** Notation

  - Consider \(J\) two-arm clinical studies with the /same treatment and control/
    and the /same set of baseline covariates/
  - Assume studies \(1, \ldots, K\) (\(K \leq J\)) are observational studies and
    the rest are randomized studies
  - In study \(S=j\), subject \(i\) with baseline covariates \(\uV_{ij}\) is
    treated with treatment \(Z_{ij}\)
  - Let \(e_{ijk} = P(Z_i=1|\uV=\uv_{ij},S=k)\) be the propensity score of
    subject \(i\) with baseline covariates \(\uv_{ij}\) on study \(k\) (\(k = 1,
    \ldots, K\))
    - \(e_{ijk}\) denotes the probability for the \(i\)th subject on the
      \(j\)th study to be assigned to the treatment arm should the subject be
      enrolled on the observational study \(k\)
  - Furthermore, let \(\ue^\dagger_{ij} = \{e_{ij1}, \ldots, e_{ijK}\}\)

** Proposition

   Under the strong ignorable treatment assignments assumption, for all $i$ and $j$,
   \[ Z_{ij} \perp Y_{ij}(0), Y_{ij}(1) | \ue^\dagger_{ij}, S=j \]


** Proof

   - \(\ue^\dagger_{ij}\) is a function of \(\uV_{ij}\) 
   - \(E(e_{ij}|\ue^\dagger_{ij}) = e_{ij}\)
   - Therefore,  \(\ue^\dagger_{ij}\) is a /balance score/ (Rosenbaum, 1983)
   - The proposition holds

** ATE in CER

   The study specific /causal treatment effect/ can be obtained by 
   
     \begin{align*}
     E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|S=j] &= \\ 
     E_{\ue^\dagger|S=j} & \left [ E\{Y|Z=1,\ue^\dagger,S=j\}
     -E\{Y|Z=0,\ue^\dagger,S=j\} \right ]
     \end{align*} 

** PS Model

   - In practice, we propose to first fit logistic regression models
     to the observational studies \(S=k\) (\(k=1,\ldots,K\)) 

     \[\logit P(Z_{ik}=1|\uV_{ik}=\uv_{ik},S=k) = \alpha_{0,k} + \uv'_{ik}\ualpha_{1,k}\]   

   - Then, estimate \(e_{ijk}\) by
     \[ \widehat{e}_{ijk} = {\exp (\widehat{\alpha}_{0,k} + \uv_{ij}' \widehat{\ualpha}_{v,k})
         \over 1 + \exp (\widehat{\alpha}_{0,k} + \uv_{ij}' \widehat{\ualpha}_{v,k} )} \]

   - Let \(\uet_{ij} = \logit \widehat{\ue}^\dagger_{ij}\)

** Hierarchical DP (HDP)
   - DP approach often shares information through the full distribution
   - Challenging to construct hierarchical DP models
   - M\uuml{}ller et al. (2004)
     \begin{equation*}
     H_j( \cdot \mid \ueta) =
     \varepsilon \underbrace{F_0(\cdot \mid \ueta)}_{common}
     +
     (1-\varepsilon)\underbrace{F_j(\cdot \mid \ueta)}_{idiosyncratic}
     \end{equation*}

** Bayesian Model

  \begin{align*}
    y_{ij}, \uet_{ij} & |Z=z, S=j \sim MVN(H^{(z)}_j, \Sigma^{(z)}_j) \\
    H^{(z)}_j &= \epsilon^{(z)} F^{(z)}_0 + (1-\epsilon^{(z)}) F^{(z)}_j \\
    F^{(z)}_j &\sim DP(G^{(z)}, M^{(z)}_j) \\
    G^{(z)}   &\sim N(m^{(z)}, B^{(z)})
  \end{align*}

** HDP

   [[file:ps_hdp.png]]


** Priors

   \begin{align*}
    m^{(z)}     &\sim N(0, 10^3) \\
    B^{(z)}     &\sim \text{Inverse-Wishart}(q_B, R_B) \\
    M^{(z)}_j   &\sim \Gamma(a_M=1, b_M=1) \\ 
    p(\epsilon) &= \pi_0 \delta_0(\epsilon) + \pi_1 \delta_1(\epsilon) \\
                & \hspace{0.5cm} + (1-\pi_0-\pi_1) Beta(a_\epsilon=1,b_\epsilon=1)
   \end{align*}

** Inference

   \begin{align*}
 p(y(z)|S=j) &= \int p(y(z)| \uet, S=j) p(\uet|S=j) d \uet  \\
 &=  \int p(y|Z=z, \uet ,S=j) p(\uet|S=j) d\uet
 \end{align*}

    - Use the empirical distribution of \(\uet\) on study \(j\) to
      approximate \(p(\uet|S=j)\)
    - The distribution \(p(y|Z=z,\uet,S=j)\) is induced from the
      prediction distribution of \((y, \uet)|Z=z, S=j, \utheta_j\) where
      \(\utheta_j\) represents the DP parameters for \(S=j\)

** Sensitivity Analysis

   - PS only balances covariates that are used to construct the score
   - /Strong ignorable treatment assignment/ assumption fails to hold when there
     are /unmeasured confounders/
   - Sensitivity analysis desirable to investigate the robustness of the study findings

** Sensitivity Analysis
   - Let $U$ denote an unmeasured confounder
   - For participants with $Z=1$, assume
     \[ P(Z=z|\uV,U) = \frac{P(Z=z|\uV) e^{\Delta z}}
                       { \sum_{z=0}^1 P(Z=z|\uV) e^{\Delta z} } \]
   - Equivalent as \[\logit P(Z=1|\uV, U) = \alpha_0 + \uV\ualpha_v + \Delta U\]
     where $P(U=1)=1$ and $0$ for $Z=1$ and 0, respectively
* Simulation Study
** Data Generation
   - 4 clinical studies ($J$ = 4) including 3 observational studies ($K$ = 3)
     and 1 randomized study
   - 10 covariates jointly follow a multivariate normal distribution
   - Treatment assignment model
      \[\logit P(Z_{ik}=1) = \alpha_{0,k} + \sum_{p=1}^7\alpha_{p,k} V_{p,i,k}\]
   - Response model
     \[Y_{ij} = \beta_{0,j} + \sum_{p=4}^{10} \beta_{p,j} V_{p,i,j} + \epsilon_{ij}\]

** Scenarios
    - Scenario I
      - same patient populations
      - same covariate effects
      - same treatment effects
      - same treatment assignment for observational studies
    - Scenario II
      - different patient populations 
        - covariates with /different variances/ among studies
    - Scenario III
      - different patient populations 
        - covariates with /different variances/ among studies
      - different treatment assignment for observational studies
    - Scenario IV
      - different patient populations 
        - covariates with /different variances/ across studies
        - covariates with /different means/ across studies
      - different treatment assignment for observational studies
